# Challenge 5: On-chain Identity DApp

## 📋 Overview
Build a dApp for registering and displaying on-chain identities on **Paseo People Chain**  with wallet integration and real-time data display.

## ⏱️ Estimated Time
**3 days**

## 🎯 Requirements

### 1. Create a UI
The dApp's user interface must allow users to register their on-chain identity. This involves creating a form where they can input their display name, legal name, and a GitHub link.

### 2. Show identity info
After a user connects their wallet, the dApp should display their already-registered identity information (display name, legal name, GitHub link) by querying the blockchain's storage.

### 3. Target Network
The dApp should be built to interact with the **Paseo People testnet**, which is the go-to testnet for Polkadot dApp developers.

## 📤 How to Submit

You'll need to submit a Pull Request (PR) containing three key components:

1. **Link to the code:** A link to the GitHub repository where the dApp's source code is hosted
2. **Link to the deployed dApp:** A link to a live version of the dApp, likely deployed on a platform like Vercel, so that it can be tested directly
3. **Video recording:** A video demonstrating the entire process of connecting a wallet, registering an on-chain identity, and then viewing that identity information on the dApp
